# AI-Friendly Package Design Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Purpose**: Summary of AI consumption and creation optimizations for logthis

## What We Built

### 1. Executable Contract System
**File**: `R/contracts.R`

**Philosophy**: **Contracts are code, not documentation.**

```r
logger <- function(void = FALSE) {
  # Preconditions (caller's responsibility)
  require_that(
    "void is logical" = is.logical(void)
  )

  # ... implementation ...

  # Postconditions (function's guarantee)
  ensure_that(
    "result is logger" = inherits(result, "logger"),
    "receivers match labels" =
      length(attr(result, "config")$receivers) ==
      length(attr(result, "config")$receiver_labels)
  )

  result
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Runtime validation (catches bugs immediately)
- Self-documenting (AI reads code, not comments)
- Single source of truth (specification IS the code)
- Extractable (tool can generate docs from contracts)

---

### 2. Documentation Layer System
**File**: `notes/DOCUMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Hierarchy**:
```
1. SOURCE OF TRUTH: R/*.R (code with contracts)
2a. EXTRACTED DOCS: inst/contracts.md (auto-generated)
2b. CURATED GUIDES: CLAUDE.md (WHY and HOW)
3. NAVIGATION INDEX: inst/AI.md (decision trees, cross-links)
```

**Single Source of Truth**:
- Every fact exists in ONE place (the code)
- Documentation is a VIEW into that truth
- Regenerate derived docs when code changes

**Minimal Redundancy**:
- Don't duplicate function signatures
- Link to code instead of copying
- Key concepts appear in multiple VIEWS, same SOURCE

---

### 3. Contract Extraction Tool
**File**: `dev/generate_contract_docs.R`

**Purpose**: Extract contracts from code → generate markdown

**Usage**:
```bash
Rscript dev/generate_contract_docs.R
```

**Output**: `inst/contracts.md` (auto-generated, don't edit manually)

**Ensures**: Documentation stays in sync with code

---

### 4. Navigation Index for AI
**File**: `inst/AI.md`

**NOT**: Duplicate documentation
**IS**: Map to find truth

**Contains**:
- Decision trees ("Want to add storage? → Check if...")
- File location quick reference
- Cross-links to code (not duplicating content)
- Common patterns (copy-paste templates)
- Gotchas with links to details

**Philosophy**: "This doc is a map. The code is the territory."

---

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Code as Truth
**Problem**: Documentation gets out of sync
**Solution**: Make code self-documenting with contracts
**Result**: Docs are DERIVED from code, not duplicated

### 2. Executable Specifications
**Problem**: Comments lie, tests break, docs rot
**Solution**: Contracts execute at runtime AND serve as docs
**Result**: Specification IS the implementation

### 3. Layered Documentation
**Problem**: One doc can't serve all audiences
**Solution**: Multiple VIEWS of same truth
**Result**: AI gets decision trees, humans get narrative guides

### 4. Cross-Linking Over Duplication
**Problem**: Facts scattered across multiple files
**Solution**: Facts in code, links everywhere else
**Result**: Update code once, regenerate docs

### 5. Discoverable via Multiple Paths
**Problem**: Hard to find information
**Solution**: Key concepts accessible from multiple entry points
**Result**: Decision trees, search terms, cross-refs all lead to same truth

## For AI Assistants: How to Use This System

### Reading Code

1. Start: `inst/AI.md` (decision trees, quick reference)
2. Contracts: `inst/contracts.md` (what functions require/guarantee)
3. Architecture: `CLAUDE.md` (why things work this way)
4. Ground truth: `R/*.R` (implementation)

### Modifying Code

1. Before: Read contracts for function you're modifying
2. During: Add contracts to your changes
3. After: Regenerate contracts.md
4. If needed: Update architecture docs

### When Confused

- **"What does this function do?"** → Check `inst/contracts.md`
- **"Why is it designed this way?"** → See `CLAUDE.md`
- **"Where do I add feature X?"** → Use decision trees in `inst/AI.md`
- **"What's the ground truth?"** → Always `R/*.R` files

---

## Maintenance Workflow

### Every Code Change
```bash
# 1. Modify R/*.R with contracts
# 2. Update tests
# 3. Regenerate derived docs
Rscript dev/generate_contract_docs.R
devtools::document()

# 4. Verify
devtools::test()
```

### When Architecture Changes
```markdown
# Update CLAUDE.md
- Architecture diagrams
- Design patterns
- Key concepts
```

### When File Structure Changes
```markdown
# Update inst/AI.md
- Decision trees
- File location references
- Cross-links
```

## Comparison to Traditional Approach

### Traditional

```r
#' Add receivers to logger
#' @param logger A logger object
#' @param ... Receiver functions
#' @return Modified logger
with_receivers <- function(logger, ...) {
  # Hope caller passed right types
  # Hope function returns what it says
  # Docs get out of sync over time
}
```

### Our Approach

```r
#' Add receivers to logger
#' @param logger A logger object
#' @param ... Receiver functions
#' @return Modified logger
with_receivers <- function(logger, ...) {
  # CONTRACTS: Executable specification
  require_that(
    "logger is logger class" = inherits(logger, "logger")
  )

  # ... implementation ...

  ensure_that(
    "result is logger" = inherits(logger, "logger"),
    "receivers added" = length(new_config$receivers) > 0
  )

  logger
}
```

**Difference**:
- Contracts execute (catch bugs immediately)
- Contracts self-document (AI reads code)
- Contracts are source of truth (generate docs from them)

## Benefits for AI Creation/Consumption

### For AI Creating Code

1. **Clear contracts**: Know what to validate
2. **Pattern templates**: Copy-paste from common patterns
3. **Decision trees**: Know where to add features
4. **Impact matrix**: Know what breaks if you change X

### For AI Consuming Code

1. **Executable specs**: Run code to understand behavior
2. **Extracted contracts**: Machine-readable requirements
3. **Cross-linked docs**: Multiple paths to same info
4. **Layered depth**: Quick reference → Details → Source

### For Future Maintainers (Human or AI)

1. **Single source of truth**: Code never lies
2. **Auto-generated docs**: Stay in sync
3. **Explicit invariants**: Know what must always hold
4. **Clear navigation**: Find things fast

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

1. **Executable contracts** - Best of both worlds (validation + documentation)
2. **Layered docs** - Different views for different needs
3. **Code as truth** - Never gets out of sync
4. **Cross-linking** - Discoverability without duplication

### What to Avoid

1. **Duplicating facts** - Always link to source instead
2. **Manual docs for auto-extractable** - Generate from code
3. **Long prose in navigation docs** - Keep it scannable
4. **Implicit invariants** - Make them executable contracts

---

## Conclusion

This system achieves:

✅ **Single source of truth** (code with contracts)
✅ **Minimal redundancy** (facts in ONE place, links everywhere)
✅ **Multiple representations** (different VIEWS of same SOURCE)
✅ **AI-readable** (contracts are code, not comments)
✅ **Maintainable** (update code → regenerate docs)
✅ **Discoverable** (decision trees, cross-links, quick refs)

**Result**: Package designed for AI consumption AND creation, maintained by humans OR AI, with code as the single source of truth.

**Philosophy**: "Make the implicit explicit. Make the explicit executable. Make the executable extractable."
