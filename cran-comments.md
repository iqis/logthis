## Package Dependencies

### Imports
* magrittr
* glue

### Suggests (Optional Features)
* testthat (>= 3.0.0) - for testing
* pkgdown - for documentation website
* knitr, rmarkdown - for vignettes
* shinyalert, shiny - for Shiny integration receivers
* jsonlite - for JSON logging
* httr2 - for webhook/Teams receivers
* arrow - for Parquet/Feather columnar formats
* aws.s3 - for AWS S3 cloud storage
* AzureStor - for Azure Blob Storage

**Note:** All Suggests packages are optional. The package gracefully handles missing packages with informative error messages directing users to install them if needed.

## Additional Comments

### Package Purpose

logthis is a structured logging framework for R providing enterprise-level logging capabilities similar to log4j or Python's logging module. It is designed for R packages, Shiny applications, and data analysis pipelines requiring robust logging infrastructure.

### Key Features

1. **Hierarchical event levels** (0-100 scale) with built-in levels (TRACE, DEBUG, NOTE, MESSAGE, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
2. **Multiple output receivers**: console, files, Shiny alerts, webhooks, Microsoft Teams, syslog, CSV, Parquet, Feather
3. **Two-level filtering**: Logger-level and receiver-level filtering for fine-grained control
4. **Functional composition**: Pipe-friendly syntax with %>%
5. **Resilient error handling**: One receiver failure doesn't stop others
6. **Structured events**: Rich metadata with timestamps, tags, and custom fields
7. **Cloud integration**: AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage support

### Examples Available

* 3 comprehensive vignettes:
  - getting-started.Rmd: Basic usage and concepts
  - tagging-and-provenance.Rmd: Tagging system and event tracking
  - advanced-receivers.Rmd: Cloud, HTTP, and structured format receivers

* Full roxygen2 documentation for all exported functions
* Extensive README with quick start and examples

### Testing Notes

* All Shiny-related receivers (to_shinyalert, to_notif) gracefully fail outside Shiny context with informative error messages
* Cloud storage receivers (S3, Azure) are tested for configuration but not actual uploads (require credentials)
* HTTP receivers (webhooks, Teams) are tested for request construction but not actual POST (require external services)

### Known Limitations

* Async logging is planned for v0.2.0 (research complete, see docs/async-logging-research.md)
* Some receivers require active external services (Shiny session, syslog daemon, etc.) - documented in help pages

### Version Number

This submission is for v0.1.0 (not 0.1.0.9000 shown in development DESCRIPTION). The .9000 suffix will be removed before CRAN submission.

## Spelling

All spelling has been checked. Technical terms used:
* "syslog" - system logging protocol
* "webhook" - HTTP callback mechanism
* "logthis" - package name
* "Parquet" - Apache Parquet columnar format
* "Feather" - Apache Arrow IPC format
* "jsonlite", "httr2", "aws.s3", "AzureStor" - package names

## Previous CRAN Comments

This is a new submission - no previous CRAN feedback to address.

## Maintainer Response to Potential Issues

### Large Number of Suggests

**Rationale:** The package provides optional integrations with various ecosystems (Shiny, cloud storage, analytics tools). Each integration is completely optional and users only install what they need. The package never fails if Suggests are missing - it provides clear error messages guiding installation when features are used.

### Development Version Number (0.1.0.9000)

**Correction:** Will submit as 0.1.0 for CRAN release.
