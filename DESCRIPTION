    Shiny alerts), configurable filtering, and rich metadata support. Designed
    for R packages, Shiny applications, and data analysis pipelines requiring
    enterprise-level logging capabilities. Developed with AI assistance (Claude Code),
    demonstrating modern AI-augmented package development with LLM-friendly design patterns.
