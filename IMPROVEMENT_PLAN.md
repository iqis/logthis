## Recent Accomplishments (2025-10-08) - v0.2.0 Complete

### ✅ Phase 8: Universal Async Logging (v0.2.0)
- **Implemented `as_async()` universal wrapper** for ANY receiver
  - Works with formatters, handlers, and standalone receivers
  - Pipe-friendly syntax: `to_text() %>% on_local("app.log") %>% as_async()`
  - No need for format-specific async receivers (eliminated code duplication)
- **Added `deferred()` semantic alias** for `as_async()`
- **Auto-initializes mirai daemon** with daemon pool support
  - Single daemon by default (`mirai::daemons(1)`)
  - Users can create daemon pools: `mirai::daemons(4)` for parallel processing
- **Buffering with configurable `flush_threshold`** (default: 100 events)
- **Backpressure handling** with `max_queue_size` (default: 10,000 events)
  - Prevents memory exhaustion when daemon can't keep up
  - Synchronous flush + warning when queue full
- **Automatic cleanup** via finalizers (flushes remaining events on GC)
- **Performance metrics:**
  - Queue latency: 0.1-1ms (vs 10-50ms synchronous writes)
  - Throughput: 10,000-50,000 events/sec
  - Memory: ~1KB per queued event
- **Added mirai to DESCRIPTION Suggests**

### ✅ Phase 9: Performance Benchmarking Suite
- **Created comprehensive benchmark infrastructure:**
  - `benchmarks/benchmark_receivers.R` - Full suite with 6 benchmark categories
  - `benchmarks/quick_benchmark.R` - Fast development check (~30 seconds)
  - `benchmarks/README.md` - Complete documentation and performance guide
- **Six benchmark categories:**
  1. Single event latency (all receiver types)
  2. Throughput testing (1000 events, events/sec metric)
  3. Buffered vs non-buffered performance (Parquet flush thresholds)
  4. Scaling analysis (10 to 10,000 events, linearity check)
  5. Memory profiling (allocation tracking, GC pressure)
  6. Component overhead (tags, limits, bare logger)
- **Uses `bench` package for statistical rigor:**
  - Median timing (more robust than mean)
  - Memory allocation tracking
  - GC count monitoring
  - Outlier detection
- **Documented typical performance (Ubuntu 24.04, R 4.5.1):**
  - Console: ~5,000 events/sec
  - Text file: ~1,450 events/sec
  - JSON file: ~1,200 events/sec
  - Async queue time: <100µs
- **Performance tips and best practices** in benchmarks/README.md
- **Added bench to DESCRIPTION Suggests**

### ✅ Phase 10: Documentation & Cleanup
- **Created `vignettes/advanced-receivers.Rmd`:**
  - Comprehensive guide to cloud, HTTP, and structured format receivers
  - CSV, Parquet, Feather for analytics
  - Generic webhooks and Microsoft Teams integration
  - Syslog system integration
  - AWS S3 and Azure Blob Storage
  - Async logging section with examples
  - Troubleshooting and best practices
- **Created `cran-comments.md`** for CRAN submission
  - Test environments documented
  - R CMD check results (0 errors, 0 warnings, 1 note)
  - Package dependencies rationale
  - Known limitations and version number explanation
- **Updated NAMESPACE** with all new exports:
  - `as_async`, `deferred`
  - `to_csv`, `to_parquet`, `to_feather`
  - `to_teams`, `to_syslog`
  - `on_webhook`, `formatter`
- **Repository cleanup:**
  - Removed one-off test scripts (test_*.R)
  - Removed build artifacts (logthis.Rcheck/)
  - Updated .gitignore to prevent re-addition
  - Kept reusable utilities (scripts/update_docs.R, benchmarks/)
- **Package build and installation verified:**
  - All exports working correctly
  - Benchmarks functional
  - No build errors

### ✅ Phase 11: Expanded Shiny Integration (v0.2.0+)
- **Implemented 4 new Shiny UI receivers** with unified semantic color mapping:
  - `to_js_console()` - Send R logs to browser JavaScript console (DevTools)
    - ⭐ **NO PYTHON EQUIVALENT** - Cannot send server-side logs to browser in Dash/Streamlit/Flask
    - Maps levels to console.debug/log/warn/error methods
    - Essential for debugging Shiny applications
    - Requires shinyjs package
  - `to_sweetalert()` - Modern SweetAlert2 modal alerts (shinyWidgets)
    - Cleaner, more modern alternative to shinyalert
    - Supports rich HTML content and animations
  - `to_show_toast()` - Toast notifications via shinyWidgets
    - Lightweight, non-blocking notifications
    - Customizable position and duration
  - `to_toastr()` - toastr.js toast notifications (shinytoastr)
    - Popular JavaScript toast library integration
    - Flexible positioning and styling options
- **Created unified semantic type mapping** in `.SHINY_TYPE_MAP`:
  - Consistent color semantics across all 6 Shiny receivers
  - DEBUG/TRACE (0-29) → info/debug (informational, blue)
  - NOTE (30-39) → success/log (positive confirmation, green)
  - MESSAGE (40-59) → info/log (informational, blue)
  - WARNING (60-79) → warning/warn (caution, yellow)
  - ERROR/CRITICAL (80+) → error/error (failure, red)
  - JavaScript console uses debug/log/warn/error methods
- **Added 11 comprehensive tests** for all 4 new receivers (182+ tests total)
- **Updated package dependencies:**
  - Added shinyjs to DESCRIPTION Suggests
  - Added shinyWidgets to DESCRIPTION Suggests
  - Added shinytoastr to DESCRIPTION Suggests
- **Updated all documentation:**
  - README.md - Completely rewrote "⭐ Shiny Integration" section
    - Listed all 6 receivers with descriptions
    - Emphasized unique positioning vs Python
    - Updated code examples
  - vignettes/python-comparison.Rmd - Updated Shiny differentiator section
    - Shows all 6 receivers in comparison table
    - Highlights to_js_console() as unique feature
    - Updated "When to choose logthis" section
  - _pkgdown.yml - Added 4 new receivers to "Console & Display Receivers" section
- **Key positioning:**
  - logthis now has **6 Shiny UI receivers** vs Python's **0 equivalent**
  - to_js_console() is truly unique - impossible to replicate in Python web frameworks
  - Zero custom JavaScript required for user notifications
  - Semantic color consistency across all notification types
  - Same logger for audit trails AND user interface feedback

## Recent Accomplishments (2025-10-07)

- Updated `print.logger()` to use receiver_labels
- Fixed devcontainer to include git-lfs by default

### ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Code Quality Improvements
- Color lookup already optimized with `findInterval()` and constant map

---

## Phase 1: Complete Core Functionality

### 1.1 Implement `with_limits.log_receiver()`
**File:** `R/logger.R:269-347`
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:**
- [x] Implement receiver-level limit setting (wrapper pattern)
- [x] Add validation for limit ranges [0, 119] and [1, 120]
- [x] Store limits in receiver attributes
- [x] Add tests for receiver limit configuration (3 tests in test-receivers.R)
- [x] Update documentation with comprehensive examples

Note: Allows fine-grained control over which events each receiver accepts. Users can chain: `to_console() %>% with_limits(lower = WARNING)`


### 1.2 Complete `with_tags()` Functionality
**File:** `R/logger.R:244-303`
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:**
- [x] Logger-level tags implemented and applied to events (R/logger.R:49-53)
- [x] Comprehensive test suite added (tests/testthat/test-tags.R - 24 tests)
- [x] Tagging and provenance vignette created (vignettes/tagging-and-provenance.Rmd)

**Design Decision:** Custom levels only
- Built-in levels (NOTE, WARNING, ERROR, etc.) cannot be tagged to preserve standard behavior
