## Recent Accomplishments (2025-10-07)

### ✅ Resilient Receiver Error Handling
- Implemented `purrr::safely()` wrapper for all receiver executions
- Receivers now execute independently - one failure doesn't stop others
- Added receiver label capture for detailed error provenance
- Receiver failures logged as ERROR events with 'receiver_error' tag
- Fallback to `to_console()` for error reporting, `warning()` as last resort
- Added comprehensive tests (111 tests passing)
- Error messages include: receiver #, error message, full receiver call

### ✅ Configuration Improvements
- Renamed `receiver_calls` to `receiver_labels` (plain text, not pairlists)
- Updated `print.logger()` to use receiver_labels
- Fixed devcontainer to include git-lfs by default

### ✅ Phase 2 Complete: Code Quality Improvements
- Color lookup already optimized with `findInterval()` and constant map
- Logger naming clear: `void_logger()` properly documented, no confusion
- Added `to_text_file()` and `to_json_file()` to README receivers section

### ✅ Phase 3 Complete: Enhanced Functionality
- File rotation already implemented in `to_text_file()` with comprehensive tests
- Added `to_json_file()` receiver for structured logging (JSONL format)
- JSON receiver supports compact/pretty formatting, full metadata, level filtering
- Added 14 new receiver tests (file rotation + JSON functionality)

### ✅ R CMD Check: Clean Results
- 0 errors ✔
- 0 warnings ✔
- 1 harmless note (timestamp verification)
- All 130 tests passing

## Phase 1: Complete Core Functionality

### 1.1 Implement `with_limits.log_receiver()`
**File:** `R/logger.R:269-347`
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:**
- [x] Implement receiver-level limit setting (wrapper pattern)

- [x] Store limits in receiver attributes
- [x] Add tests for receiver limit configuration (3 tests in test-receivers.R)
- [x] Update documentation with comprehensive examples

Note: Allows fine-grained control over which events each receiver accepts. Users can chain: `to_console() %>% with_limits(lower = WARNING)`


### 1.2 Complete `with_tags()` Functionality

- [x] Tagging and provenance vignette created (vignettes/tagging-and-provenance.Rmd)
- [x] README updated with tag examples

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Complete `with_tags.log_event_level()` - auto-apply tags to all events of that level

- [x] Documentation in receiver code

### 2.2 Clarify Logger Naming Conventions ✅
**Status:** No confusion exists
**Completed:**
- [x] `void_logger()` properly exported and documented
- [x] No `dummy_logger()` in codebase
- [x] README examples consistent

### 2.3 Fix Documentation Inconsistencies ✅
**Status:** Complete
**Completed:**
- [x] Added `to_text_file()` to README built-in receivers section

- [x] `to_identity()` correctly documented as testing receiver
- [x] Clear distinction between testing and production receivers

- [x] `max_files` parameter limits rotation history
- [x] Rotation logic: log.txt → log.1.txt → log.2.txt
- [x] Tests verify rotation, file limits, log order preservation
- [x] Documentation with rotation examples
- [x] 2 comprehensive rotation tests added

### 3.2 Add JSON Receiver for Modern Log Aggregation ✅
**File:** `R/receivers.R:318-401`
**Status:** Complete with comprehensive tests
**Completed:**
- [x] `to_json_file()` receiver creates JSONL format (one JSON per line)
- [x] Full event metadata: time, level, level_number, message, tags
- [x] Compact output by default for efficiency
- [x] Optional pretty-printing via `pretty = TRUE`
- [x] Level filtering support (lower/upper limits)
- [x] 3 comprehensive tests: JSONL output, filtering, pretty printing
- [x] Documentation with cloud logging examples
- [x] Added jsonlite dependency to DESCRIPTION

### 3.3 Add Async/Buffered Logging Support
